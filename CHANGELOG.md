## 0.10.0

**Breaking:**

- Reworked `BPKGradient` interface. `stops` now has the type `NSArray<NSNumber *> *` instead of `NSArray<NSValue *> *` of `CGPoint`s. A `startPoint` and `endPoint` of type `CGPoint` has been introduced and `stops` now indicate how far along the line formed by those two points the color sits.

**Added:**

- Added two new initializers to `BPKGradient`: `-initWithColors:stops:startPoint:endPoint` and `-initWithColors:startPoint:endPoint`.
- `BPKGradientView`(`Backpack.GradientView` in Swift) for drawing instance of `BPKGradient`.
