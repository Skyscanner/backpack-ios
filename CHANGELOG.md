# Backpack iOS changelog

[Unreleased changes](./UNRELEASED.md).

### 8.0.0

**Breaking:**

- Backpack/Theme
  - Theme container classes are no longer exposed by Backpack/Theme. Instead they must be accessed using the `container` method of the themes.

### 7.0.0

**Breaking:**

- Backpack/Calendar
  - Changed the external interface of the Calendar to use a simple time zone independent date class, `BPKSimpleDate`/`SimpleDate`. All methods and properties that previously used `NSDate` in the device's local time zone now use `BPKSimpleDate` instead.
  - `minDate`, `maxDate`, and `locale` in `BPKCalendar`/`Calendar` are now correctly `nonnull`.

**Added:**

- Backpack/Calendar
  - Added a method: `simpleDateFromDate:`/`simpleDate(from:)` to `BPKCalendar`/`Calendar` to convert from `NSDate` in the device's local time zone to `BPKSimpleDate`/`SimpleDate`.
  - Added a method: `dateFromSimpleDate:`/`date(from:)` to `BPKCalendar`/`Calendar` to convert from `BPKSimpleDate`/`SimpleDate` to `NSDate` in the device's locale time zone.
  - Added a new initializer to `BPKCalendar`/`Calendar` to create a calendar with a predefined `minDate` and `maxDate`. This initializer is preferred.

### 6.6.3

### 6.3.0

**Added:**

  - Added a new class `BPKIconView`(`IconView` in Swift) for displaying icons. It is based on `UIImageView` and the perfect choice when you just want to display an icon with a tint.

    ```objective-c
    #import <Backpack/Color.h>
    #import <Backpack/Icon.h>

    BPKIconView *iconView = [[BPKIconView alloc] initWithIconName:BPKIconNameAccessibility
                                                               size:BPKIconSizeLarge];
    iconView.tintColor = BPKColor.blue500;
    ```

### 6.2.1

+ Backpack/Button
  + Bug fix to ensure disabled style is not overridden when title is set.
  + Bug fix to make link button background transparent.

### 6.2.0

**Added:**

+ Backpack/Icon
  + Added new icons
    + `BPKIconNameSocialLike`
    + `BPKIconNameGridLayout`

+ Backpack/Font
    + Added new API to make it easier to deal with custom attributes. `attributesForForStyle:withCustomAttributes:` in Objective-C and `makeAttributes(fontStyle:customAttributes:)` in Swift. Note this API will ignore some overrides that would change the text rendering to the point where it is no longer conforming to the Backpack style.
+

### Migrating to the new type scale

The good news are that if you already use one of the higher level components you don't need to do anything. If you are directly using `BPKFont` some methods have been removed, specifically those that return `UIFont *` directly. The new type scale requires greater control of text rendering, because of this `UIFont` instances are not enough to fully qualify text. Example migration

#### Before

```objective-c
UIFont *font [BPKFont textBase];
// Use `font`
```

#### After

```objective-c
NSAttributedString *attributedString = [BPKFont attributedStringWithFontStyle:BPKFontStyleTextBase content:@"Hello"];
// Use `attributedString`

// There's also `(NSAttributedString *)attributedStringWithFontStyle:(BPKFontStyle)fontStyle content:(NSString *)content textColor:(UIColor *)textColor`
// if you need control of the color use to render the font(the default is gray700).
// `+ (NSDictionary<NSAttributedStringKey, id> *)attributesForFontStyle:(BPKFontStyle)fontStyle` is useful when you need to construct an `NSAttributedString` yourself.
```
