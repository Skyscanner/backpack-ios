## Usage

`BPKTextView` contains the Backpack TextView component which is a subclass of `UITextView` with Skyscanner styles. It accepts a Backpack font style to set the desired size.

### Objective-C

```objective-c
#import <Backpack/TextView.h>

BPKTextView *textView = [[BPKTextView alloc] initWithFontStyle:BPKFontStyleTextBase];
// Position textView with autolayout or other method
```

### Swift

```swift
import Backpack

let textView = BPKTextView(fontStyle: .base)
// Position TextView with autolayout or other method
```

## Dynamic Text

`BPKTextView` doesn't currently support **Dynamic Text**, but this is planned for a later release.
