# Backpack/StarRating

## Usage

`BPKStarRating` contains the Backpack Star rating component which is a view that's rendering star shaped items filled with color to indicate rating from 0.0 to 5.0. It supports three sizes considering the available `BPKIcon` sizes.
By default `userInteractionEnabled` is set to `NO` but we can change this value to `YES` to allow the users to change the rating value by tapping the component
