/*
 * Note that in some places we are having to resolve the correct UIColors from dynamic values ourselves to ensure
 * that we support overriding UIViewController interface styles. if we allow UIKit to resolve them for us,
 * it may do so wrongly.
 * This is because UIKit only sets the UIView's trait collection on a handful of lifecycle methods, and we
 * are using dynamic colours outside of these. If we do not manually resolve colours using self.traitCollection,
 * then UIKit will fall back to using [UITraitCollection currentTraitCollection] which does not reflect the override.
