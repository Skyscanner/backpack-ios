## Installation

Backpack is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
all of it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Backpack'

This will install all of Backpack. We use subspecs to subdivide the library so you might want to only install specific subspecs instead.
