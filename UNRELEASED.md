# Unreleased

**Breaking:**

- Backpack/Font
  - The new type scale is here and with it some parts of `BPKFont` have been removed, but fear not `BPKFont` has gained new capabilities too. See the migration guide below.

**Added:**

- Backpack/Badge
- Backpack/Button
- Backpack/Dialog
- Backpack/Label
- Backpack/TextView
  - All these component use the new type scale.


### Migrating to the new type scale

The good news are that if you already use one of the higher level components you don't need to do anything. If you are directly using `BPKFont` some methods have been removed, specifcally those that return `UIFont *` directly. The new type scale requires greater control of text rendering, because of this `UIFont` instances are not enough to fully qualify text. Example migration

#### Before

```objective-c
UIFont *font [BPKFont textBase];
// Use `font`
```

#### After

```objective-c
NSAttributedString *attributedString = [BPKFont attributedStringWithFontStyle:BPKFontStyleTextBase content:@"Hello"];
// Use `attributedString`

// There's also `(NSAttributedString *)attributedStringWithFontStyle:(BPKFontStyle)fontStyle content:(NSString *)content textColor:(UIColor *)textColor`
// if you need control of the color use to render the font(the default is gray700).
// `+ (NSDictionary<NSAttributedStringKey, id> *)attributesForFontStyle:(BPKFontStyle)fontStyle` is useful when you need to construct an `NSAttributedString` yourself.
```
