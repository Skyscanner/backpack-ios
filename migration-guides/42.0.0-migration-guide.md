# 42.0.0 BPKCalendar Migration Guide

This guide explains how to migrate use of `BPKCalendar` in the `42.0.0` release.

In common for all the scenarios described below is the fact that you'll need to provide more strings for accessibility purposes. These strings should be localised in the traveller's language.

**Note:** All of the relevant strings are required in each constructor.

## Single Selection

Single selection is the simplest case.

### Before

```swift
calendar.selectionType = .single
```

### After

```swift
var singleSelectionConfiguration = BPKCalendarSelectionConfigurationSingle(
    selectionHint: "Double tap to select date"
)

calendar.selectionConfiguration = singleSelectionConfiguration
```

## Range Selection

Range selection is very complex and requires quite a few strings to provide a good screen reader experience.

### Before

```swift
calendar.selectionType = .range
```

### After

```swift
var rangeSelectionConfiguration = BPKCalendarSelectionConfigurationRange(
    startSelectionHint: "Double tap to select departure date",
    endSelectionHint: "Double tap to select return date",
    startSelectionState: "Selected as departure date",
    endSelectionState: "Selected as return date",
    betweenSelectionState: "Between departure and return date",
    startAndEndSelectionState: "Selected as both departure and return date",
    returnDatePrompt: "Now please select a return date"
)

calendar.selectionConfiguration = rangeSelectionConfiguration
```


## Multiple Selection


### Before

```swift
calendar.selectionType = .multiple
```

### After

```swift
var multipleSelectionConfiguration = BPKCalendarSelectionConfigurationMultiple(
    selectionHint: "Double tap to select date",
    deselectionHint: "Double tap to deselect date"
)

calendar.selectionConfiguration = multipleSelectionConfiguration
```
