## Prerequisites

### Licence
By contributing your code, you agree to license your contribution under the terms of the [APLv2](./LICENSE).

All files are released with the Apache 2.0 licence.

### Environment

We use both Ruby and Node in this project. To manage these language runtimes we recommend using [`rbenv`][0] and [`nvm`][1] respectively. You should ensure you have these installed or some other means of handling Ruby and Node versions. The required ruby version is specified in `.ruby-version` and the Node version is in `.nvmrc`.

With `rbenv` use `rbenv install` to install the project's version of Ruby. For `nvm` use `nvm use`. Also ensure you install `bundler` for Ruby with `gem install bundler`.

Use the version of Xcode specified in [our build pipeline](https://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack-ios/blob/main/.github/workflows/_build.yml#L131), however the project should work with old versions of the same major. 

### Code style

**All new components should be written in Swift.**

Please follow the [New York Times Objective-C style-guide](https://github.com/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide) when writing Objective-C. Follow other conventions and patterns established in the source code already when the style-guide cannot help you. The goal is that the codebase should look like it was written by a single author.

Wrap all Objective-C in `NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN` and `NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_END` blocks. Make sure to annotate any types that are nullable correctly.

## Getting started
Given that you have a compatible environment as stated above you can now setup the project.

- `bundle install` to install ruby dependencies
- `npm install` to install npm dependencies
- `(cd Example && bundle exec pod install)` To setup the example project.
- `open Example/Backpack.xcworkspace` to open the example project

## Adding a new component
If you want to add a new component, we will need the following:

- Design (Figma file)
- UIKit or SwiftUI component
- Accessibility
- Stories
- Tests (unit & snapshot)
- Documentation (Including main `REAMDE.md`)

### Design

Figma is the preferred format for non-technical folks. We‚Äôd appreciate if you could provide an exact match of your component in Figma format together with examples for each state e.g. disabled, expanded etc.

### UIKit and SwiftUI component

Make sure that when you contribute you are considering a UIKit and a SwiftUI version of your component. The UIKit component should live in the Backpack folder. A SwiftUI component needs to be located in Backpack-SwiftUI.

A component folder structure is setup as follows. Please take a look at the setup of existing components for examples. 

* Backpack
    - {ComponentName}
        - Classes
            - BPK{ComponentName.swift}
            - {Any supporting swift files}
        - README.md

For SwiftUI the root folder will be `Backpack-SwiftUI`. The structure is otherwise the same.

### Accessibility
Our design system tries to deliver accessible components. When designing your component make sure the accessibility of your component is considered.

At a mimimum you should make sure your component meets the following criteria:

* Colour contrast meets AA standard
* Required accessibility labels are passed to the component
* Screen readers can interact with the component
* The component can scale when the font-size increases

### Stories
Each component needs to be visually documented in our example app. Make sure to add a new entry and showcase your component in each of its different states and variants. 

### Tests
Our components need to be well tested. We require all business logic to be covered by unit tests. The component and all of its types and states need to be captured in Snapshot tests. Please review existing components to learn how we set up these tests.

### Documentation
See our design system documentation at [skyscanner.design](https://www.skyscanner.design).

## How we review Backpack contributions

Please see the [code review guidelines](https://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack/blob/main/CODE_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md).

## How to

<details>
    <summary>Testing</summary>

Tests can be run as usual from Xcode(Product -> Test or cmd+U). Snapshot tests should be run on the [device specified for CI](https://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack-ios/blob/main/scripts/ci#L7).
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Documentation screenshots</summary>

### Taking screenshots

The _screenshots_ folder stores all of the screenshots we use on the [documentation site](https://skyscanner.design). If you change the appearance of a component you must update the screenshots accordingly. To do this, run:

```
./scripts/take-screenshots
```

The script takes 10-15 minutes.

### Taking a subset of screenshots

It's possible to take only a subset of the screenshots which greatly speeds up the process.

To do this follow the following steps:


1. In `Example/Backpack Screenshot/BackpackSnapshotTestCase.swift` change the `runOnly` property per the guide in the comment.
2. Run the screenshots as above
3. Note that all other screenshots will be deleted in the process, so make sure you only commit the ones you generated not the deletions.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Snapshot testing</summary>

Snapshot tests are used to capture images of components under different configurations. When you add or change a snapshot test, test images will need to be recaptured. To do this, change `isRecording = false` to `isRecording = true` in the relevant test file and re-run the tests on the [device specified for CI](https://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack-ios/blob/main/scripts/ci#L7). This will update the images on disk. Remember to revert `isRecording` afterwards otherwise the tests will fail.
</details>

## And finally..

If you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to get in touch. We love to talk all things Backpack and we look forward to seeing your contribution!


## Skyscanner employees

<details>
    <summary>Relative font</summary>

Our fonts can only be used by Skyscanner employees. If you don't work for Skyscanner don't worry - the Example app will still work just fine with iOS system font too!

To use our `Skyscanner Relative` font-face in the example app do the following:

- Make sure you're connected to the VPN.
- If you've already done a `pod install`, delete `Example/Pods`.
- Set the environment variable using `export BPK_USE_RELATIVE=1`. (Put this in your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` for convenience.)
- Setup the project as [above](#setup).

During pod install, fonts will be downloaded and made available to the project automatically.

<details>
    <summary>Upgrading Xcode / iOS</summary>

## Upgrading Xcode/iOS

As new versions of Xcode and iOS are released, we have to upgrade both to stay up to date with the main Skyscanner app, as well as what travellers are using. Our aim is to run our main test suite and snapshot tests on the dominate iOS version in use by Skyscanner travellers. At the time of a new release we continue to run our test suite on the previous major version until the new release has reached sufficient volume **and** the main app has moved to testing on the new version.

### How to upgrade

1. Change the value of `runs-on` in [`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml#26). The new value should be on of the [available environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/tree/main/images/macos) in GitHub Actions.
1. Update the `BUILD_SDK` variable in [`Rakefile`](./Rakefile#5) to the new build SDK we should use.
1. Update `correctMajorVersion` and `correctMinorVersion` in [`BPKSnapshotTest`](./Example/SnapshotTests/BPKSnapshotTest.h).
1. Update `expectedMajorVersion` and `expectedMinorVersion` in [`BPKSnapshotTest.swift`](./Example/SnapshotTests/BPKSnapshotTest.swift#26).
1. Run all snapshot tests.
1. **Review the failing snapshots thoroughly.** Most likely, all snapshots will have changed, **but** the diffs should be miniscule and mostly to do with changes in Apple's fonts.
1. **Run all snapshot tests in record mode.** At the time of writing this involves manually setting `recordMode` in every test case, we should have a better method than this, but alas we don't :(
1. Manually test the example app with the new version.

## Experimental changes

Want to run A/B experiments on features that entail changes to Backpack components? Continue reading below üëá

<details>
<summary>When is a component change considered experimental?</summary>

If the component or change you want to contribute to Backpack is not stable and it depends on the results of an experiment then it is considered experimental.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What do you need to do to mark a component or part of a component as experimental?</summary>

This will depend on what kind of change you are contributing.

**Patch and minor changes**

For patch and minor changes, you should use AppleDoc annotations. AppleDoc is a widely used and supported tool in the Swift ecosystem that allows developers to document their code. AppleDoc comments will be visible in Xcode.

**Major**

For major changes, you should create a new experimental V2 component. If the experiment is successful, the old component should be deprecated.

Any follow-up changes to experimental components will not be considered breaking.
</details>

<details>
<summary>When should documentation be created and published?</summary>

Each Bpk component has a corresponding README file which contains information about the component such as usage examples and API documentation. Our components' full documentation is at [skyscanner.design](https://www.skyscanner.design). New experimental components should have a README file, but don‚Äôt need to be published to [skyscanner.design](https://www.skyscanner.design). Instead, when an experiment has run and is considered successful and so the change is stable, documentation can be published.

For changes to existing components, make sure the API documentation is updated to indicate if something is experimental.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How long does experimentation code live in Backpack?</summary>

Experimentation code should be cleaned up at most 2 weeks after an experiment has completed. In the case of a successful experiment, annotations should be removed and documentation should be published. In the case of an unsuccessful experiment, the code should be removed altogether.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>

Here‚Äôs an end-to-end example on how to add an experimental prop to a Bpk component:

1. Reach out to Koala with the proposed change
2. Contribute code changes. Make sure the API table is updated too!
```swift
/// - Experiment: This property is experimental and subject to change. Use with caution
public var type: BPKChipType = .option {
    didSet {
        updateLookAndFeel()
    }
}
```
3. Released by Koala
4. Adopt changes in project
5. Run experiment
    - if experiment is successful, publish documentation (only Koala members) and remove experimental code.
    - if experiment is unsuccessful and further iterations are needed, repeat from step 2. Otherwise, remove experimental code. That‚Äôs all!
</details>


## Releasing
> Backpack team only

To issue a new release:
* Publish draft release

The release workflow will also trigger our design docs publish. If successful, you should see your component changes at [skyscanner.design](https://skyscanner.design).

 > Note: Don't forget that new components need to be added manually!
